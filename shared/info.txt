Every class in here is shared between the projects in projects/ - these classes can be created in the scripting engine and registered as prefabs.
Functions registered in here will also be available in all projects.
This is so all the different programs that your game comes with (usually just your game and its editor) can use the same code.

This is under the provision that you are using the example project format with the default $(MAGE_SHARED_SRC) left in place.
