#Multiplatform Arcade Game Engine Devkit
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Qf707M2.png)

Unfinished SFML-based game engine with:
- Scripting engine (chai)
- Object oriented design
- Shader support
- Cameras
- Gamestates
- Levels
- Serialization
- Animation
- Scheduling and tweening
- Resource management

#Using This
MAGEDevkit does most everything for you so you can use the engine faster and quicker.
CMakeLists files are full of comments and information.
No need to mess around trying to bind MAGE and SFML to a project - this is done for you, and they're compiled on any system for you too!

#The Editor
The editor is only available if the required libraries are available:
- WxWidgets (Cmake must be able to find it somewhere and the version must be compatible with your build settings)
- GTK (linux only)
- X11 (linux only, and if you have linux it's probably already on your computer)

#Using MAGE on its own
- See https://github.com/Sixmorphugus/MAGE
- Honestly, MAGEDevkit is quite a bit easier...
